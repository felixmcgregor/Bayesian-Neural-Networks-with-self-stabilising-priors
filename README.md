# Bayesian-Neural-Networks-with-self-stabilising-priors
Bayesian neural networks with self stabilising priors. Priors are derived using signal propagation theory to stabilise the signal propagation dynamics.

This repo is based on https://github.com/senya-ashukha/sparse-vd-pytorch. We build on this to produce an interpretable implementation of self-stabilising priors.
